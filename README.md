DCIT 23 COMPUTER PROGRAMMING 2

Activity #1: This Java program is a simple console-based Employee Information System designed to collect basic employee details (first name, last name, age, hours worked, and hourly wage) and then calculate and display their full name and daily salary. It demonstrates fundamental Java concepts like user input using Scanner, variable declaration, data types, string concatenation, and basic arithmetic operations.

Activity #2: This Java program is an enhanced version of the Employee Information System. Building upon Activity #1, this program now calculates not only the daily salary but also the weekly, monthly, gross yearly, and net yearly salaries. It introduces more advanced concepts like calculating years until retirement, applying tax deductions and government-mandated benefits, and precise decimal formatting using DecimalFormat and RoundingMode. The employee's full name is now displayed in uppercase, with the last name preceding the first name.
