DCIT 23 COMPUTER PROGRAMMING 2

ðŸŽ¯ Activities:
Activity #1: Employee Information System is a simple console-based Employee Information System designed to collect basic employee details (first name, last name, age, hours worked, and hourly wage) and then calculate and display their full name and daily salary. It demonstrates fundamental Java concepts like user input using Scanner, variable declaration, data types, string concatenation, and basic arithmetic operations.

Activity #2: Employee Information System Part 2 is an enhanced version of the Employee Information System. Building upon Activity #1, this program now calculates not only the daily salary but also the weekly, monthly, gross yearly, and net yearly salaries. It introduces more advanced concepts like calculating years until retirement, applying tax deductions and government-mandated benefits, and precise decimal formatting using DecimalFormat and RoundingMode. The employee's full name is now displayed in uppercase, with the last name preceding the first name.

Activity #3: Employee Information System (Conditional Statements) is the third iteration of the Employee Information System, significantly enhanced by the introduction of conditional statements. It now includes input validation for age (disallowing minors and senior citizens) and hours worked (ensuring realistic daily limits and non-zero input). Furthermore, it uses a switch statement to assign an employee's role based on a provided code and implements a conditional tax calculation for the net yearly salary: employees earning over â‚±250,000 gross annually incur a 32% tax deduction, in addition to the â‚±1,500 government-mandated benefits. This activity showcases robust error handling and decision-making logic using if-else if-else and switch constructs.

Activity #4: This activity Employee Information System (GUI Version) marks a big jump from our previous command-line tools! We're now diving into the world of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) with a visual Employee Information System. Instead of typing into a black console, we'll interact with actual input boxes and a button to get the results. This program lets users input employee data like First name, Last name, age, hours worked, and hourly wage directly into a window. After clicking "Compute," it instantly displays the employee's full name, age, and calculated daily wage within the same window. It's a fantastic introduction to Java's AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) for building simple desktop applications, complete with basic input validation and error handling for a smoother user experience.

Activity #5: This activity named "Quiz App" is a simple, interactive quiz application built using Java AWT. Unlike the previous activities, this one isn't about data entry, it's designed to present multiple-choice questions to the user. this activity you'll answer questions by selecting one of the radio button choices and then clicking "Next." The app keeps track of your score and provides a nice summary once you've finished all the questions. It's a fantastic showcase of how to manage program state (like the current question and score), handle user interactions with GUI elements, and dynamically update the display based on user choices.

Activity #6: This activity takes GUI development to the next level by transitioning from AWT to Java Swing. Here we're building a practical To-Do List application that features a main window displaying tasks in a table and a separate pop-up window for adding new tasks. Users can input a task name, a description, and select its status (Not Started, Ongoing, Completed). The application validates inputs, adds the new task to the main table, and provides a much more modern and flexible user interface compared to AWT. This project is excellent for understanding multi-window Swing applications, JTable for data display, and dynamic data management. 

ðŸŽ¯ Exams:
Midterm Laboratory Exam: IT Ticket Management System (Console-Based) program steps back to a console-based interface but takes a giant leap forward in demonstrating core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It's a simple IT Ticket Management System that lets you add new support tickets, update their status, view all active tickets, and even generate a basic report summarizing ticket statuses. The real highlight here is the introduction of a custom Ticket class, which allows us to model each support ticket as an individual object with its own properties (like ticket number, description, urgency, and status) and behaviors. The system includes robust input validation to ensure data integrity and user-friendly menu navigation.

Final Laboratory Exam: For our Final Exam we're develop a GUI-based  Calculator application using Java Swing. It goes far beyond basic arithmetic, offering a comprehensive set of features including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage, square root, and even exponentiation. Also I add handy memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC) and a clear history display to keep track of your operations. The calculator also includes smart input handling for decimals and negative numbers, along with user-friendly error messages (like "Div by 0"). With its custom button styling and responsive design, this activity showcases how to create powerful and visually appealing desktop applications in Java.
